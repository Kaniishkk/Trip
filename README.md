"Trip" is a web application designed to simplify group expense tracking, especially useful for trips, outings, or shared events. Inspired by Splitwise, Trip allows users to log shared expenses, split costs among participants, and keep track of who owes whom, all within a clean, user-friendly interface. Key features include:

Group Expense Management: Users can create groups for different events (e.g., vacations, gatherings) and add expenses to each group. Trip calculates each personâ€™s share of expenses based on the group setup and provides a clear summary of what each person owes or is owed.

Individual Expense Tracking: Beyond groups, users can log individual expenses to see their personal spending patterns, making the app useful even for solo expense tracking.

Secure User Authentication with Google OTP: Trip includes secure authentication via Google email verification with OTP (One-Time Password) to ensure safe access and protect user data.

Expense Summary and Settlement: The app automatically balances expenses, showing who owes whom, and allows users to mark payments as settled, keeping a clean record of past transactions and balances.
